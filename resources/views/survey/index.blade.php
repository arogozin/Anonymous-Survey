                        This is an anonymous survey for a study being conducted by your instructor in this class, Dr. Christopher Leslie, and Lindsay Anderberg, Tandon School of Engineering Archivist and User Services Librarian. We do not think that anything you write here would impact your reputation in the class or your grades, but to make sure, Dr. Leslie will not have access to the survey responses until after grades have been submitted for the semester. Furthermore, your participation in this study is voluntary. Feel free to skip any questions you do not want to answer. We will use this information to make presentations and write articles about the experience of undergraduates who conduct library research. If you do not want to be quoted (anonymously) about any of these questions, please do not write anything for an answer. If you have questions, please feel free to email one of us at chris.leslie@nyu.edu or landerberg@nyu.edu.
